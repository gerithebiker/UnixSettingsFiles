# If "/etc/utmp" is writable by screen, an appropriate record will be
# written to this file for each window, and removed when the window is
# terminated.  This is useful for working with "talk", "script",
# "shutdown", "rsend", "sccs" and other similar programs that use the
# utmp file to determine who you are. As long as screen is active on
# your terminal, the terminal's own record is removed from the utmp
# file. 
# This setting sets off umtp update of /etc/umtp file.
